        <div class="rightdiv"> 
          <p style="color: black;">Over the past three months, we have learned and applied javascript and html through web222. In fact, I had no experience in web programming before, so the first time was a little difficult. However, good materials, good examples, and recorded lectures helped me understand and apply by watching again even if I didn't understand.
            Since that was assignments that applies the contents learned in the lecture as they are, it helped me a lot to make these knowledge mine, and I checked the theories once again through quizzes.
            Through this lecture, I learned about the basics of javascript and html tags, css files, DOMs, and json. And I created a web page through what I learned, but when I created the web page, I realized that it was a more complicated and time-consuming work than I thought. I also felt a sense of accomplishment while looking at the completed web page.
            web222 is a lecture for web322 in the upcoming third semester, so it will be very helpful to understand web322.</p>
